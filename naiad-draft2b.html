<h3>A Quiet Puddle, A Strong Gust</h3>
</p><p>The sound of the wind blowing through trees. Birds chirping in the branches. Sunlight gently warming my body. Grass tickling my arms.</p>
<p>I was lying in the grass in a forest clearing, a spring to my left flowing into a glasslike pond at my feet. By my best judgment, it was late morning. I leaned over and looked into the water. My reflection gazed back, a young woman with long wavy pale blue hair&mdash;almost like a blue version of blonde. I'd never seen this face before, but somehow I recognized it as my own.</p>
<p>The water seemed to beckon to me, like a mother calling her child into her embrace. Only intending to step in, I instinctively dove head-first into the pond. The entire world exploded with clarity. Before, my vision had been on the hazy side, a [familiar] nearsightedness. Now, the underwater space was in crisp focus. I almost seemed to <i>feel</i> everything around me as precisely as I could see it. Though the surface covered only around 1,000 square feet, it was surprisingly deep and felt delightfully spacious.</p>
<p>For the first time, I realized that my legs were coated in greenish-blueish scales, and my feet were somewhat webbed.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Naiad.&rdquo;</span> The word slipped from my lips. That's what I was&mdash;something like a water spirit. With a flick of my feet, I darted forward. Yes, yes! Faster and faster I swam circuits around the pond. The water rushing across my entire body filled me with a deep energy and contentedness. Yes! This was life!</p>
<p>While I would have liked to swim forever in childlike bliss, I was getting tired and a little hungry. Food. Where was the food? <i>What</i> was the food? I could eat those fish staring at me with their judgmental little eyes, but then the tiny ecosystem in my pond might suffer.</p>
<p>So, I pushed my head out of the surface and looked around, hoping to find something before I truly got hungry. Though the wind had calmed, a gust-like sound came from above. I tilted my head just in time to see a large bird descending upon me.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<span class="pagenumber">Page 3</span>
<span class="pageheader">1&mdash;A Quiet Puddle, A Strong Gust</span>
<p>
 <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Yah!?&rdquo;</span> I dodged back into the water and peered from the safety of my depths. It was... a harpy? And she was... beckoning to me.</p>
<p>Cautiously, I returned to the surface.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;There you are, you shy little thing!&rdquo;</span> the <span class="squote">&lsquo;harpy&rsquo;</span> said.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Shy, my dorsal fin!&rdquo;</span> I had made a weird joke already. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;What were you trying to do to me?!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Sorry, sorry! I thought you were a delicious fish.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;What part of this says <span class="squote">&lsquo;fish&rsquo;</span> to you?&rdquo;</span> My only fish-like features had been underwater at the time.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;The part about you sticking your head out of the water, silly! My name is Darcy. I haven't seen you before. Are you a traveling naiad? What should I call you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Ah&mdash;this pond might have been a regular food source for Darcy. No wonder she thought I was a fish. <i>No wonder there were so few fish! My precious ecosystem!</i></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Hello? Name?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;I don't have a name!&rdquo;</span> I yelled out.</p>
<p>Darcy looked on confusedly, uncertain what I was upset about. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Ohhh!&rdquo;</span> she said with an <span class="squote">&lsquo;I get it now&rsquo;</span> pose. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;You were just born from the pond, weren't you?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Born?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Yeah! We spirits aren't birthed from parents like animals. It's more like, hmmm, like you <i>are</i> the pond. Or a piece of it, anyway.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>That doesn't make any sense, but somehow I understand.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;There are lots and lots of types of spirits, but you and I are cousins, so warm up to me already, will ya?&rdquo;</span> Darcy said as she pushed her face close to mine. I hadn't realized that I drifted to the shore. Her charisma really took my guard down.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;C-cousins?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;We're both nomids, aren't we?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;...&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Darcy went on to explain that within the world were beings that were naturally born, such as humans</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<span class="pagenumber">Page 4</span>
<span class="pageheader">1&mdash;A Quiet Puddle, A Strong Gust</span>
<p class="nohang">
 and animals, and beings that simply <span class="squote">&lsquo;arrived&rsquo;</span>, pieces of nature transformed, called spirits or <span class="dquote">&ldquo;sprights&rdquo;</span>. Among the sprights were those especially close to nature, the five nomids: nephel born from the winds, dryad of the trees, naiad of the waters, orid of the earth, and hephal of the flames beneath. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Nephel and naiad are particularly close. See, my talons are perfect for catching large fish like you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>I jumped back in horror.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;You really were trying to eat me!!&rdquo;</span> ( ꒪Д꒪)ノ</p>
<p>Darcy shook with laughter, her face losing some color from lack of breath. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;You&mdash;are&mdash;priceless! You are a dear! No, see, nephel and naiad enjoy the most freedom, as they're not bound to solid objects like stone or trees. We should totally go on a journey together!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;You'd probably end up cooking me over a campfire.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>The thought of roasted fish tripled my hunger, and my stomach let out a loud groan. Darcy put a hand over her mouth and giggled. Geez, this girl.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;What do naiads eat, anyway?&rdquo;</span> I asked.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;What do you feel like eating?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Fish.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Ha! A pondling with the tastes of a river naiad. You really are a treasure. As you know, I like fish too&mdash;real big fish.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>With my eyebrows alone I told her <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Yes, I know already&rdquo;</span>. Darcy then looked hungrily into the pond.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Keep your claws out of my ecosystem,&rdquo;</span> I warned.</p>
<p>Darcy sighed, <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Nothing to be done about it, then. Come, let's go to the river.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>For some reason, her hand was still over her mouth. Weird girl.</p>
<div class="shortbreak"></div>
<p>Ultimately, I followed her to the <span class="squote">&lsquo;river&rsquo;</span>. It was a glorified creek&mdash;knee deep and only around six feet wide. Nevertheless, it had a bountiful supply of fish. As it turned out, I was a complete failure at grabbing fish</p>
</div>
<div class="page">

<p class="nohang">
 out of the water, so Darcy took care of that (and built a fire) while I gathered edible leaves and roots that she had shown me on the way over.</p>
<p>Her talon technique really was something else.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Eat up, dear.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>The raw and cooked fish were near equally delicious, or perhaps I had just gotten that hungry. The leaves and roots were tolerable&mdash;some were even good&mdash;but I tended toward the meat.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;My, my. If you keep eating meat like that, you'll get fat, and-&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;And you'll eat me,&rdquo;</span> I finished her sentence. This was going to be a recurring joke, wasn't it?</p>
<p>The fire crackled.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;That's right! I forgot to name you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Quit playing as my mother,&rdquo;</span> I objected.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;'Phos'.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>I was ignored. And did she even put any thought into that name?</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;It means light. I thought of it when I noticed how beautifully light reflects from your scales.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><i>W-well then I guess it can't be helped.</i></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo;</span> I weakly consented.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Hmm? You... like it?!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;I-It'll do for now, I suppose.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Yaaaaaaaaaayyyyy!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>I covered my ears. <i>So noisy!</i></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;So, Phos, we're halfway to the village. How about I take you to meet some people before returning you to your puddle?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><i>Village? A nomid village?</i></p>
<div class="shortbreak"></div>
<p>The afternoon sunlight cast beams through clouds of dust. Houses made of rough-cut wooden boards lined a dirt road. Many of them had some sort of flag or banner on the front, all with the same design.</p>
<p>A moment ago, carts had been rolling and people busily walking around,</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<span class="pagenumber">Page 6</span>
<span class="pageheader">1&mdash;A Quiet Puddle, A Strong Gust</span>
<p class="nohang">
 but now they all stood silent, staring our way. Humans. My first encounter with humans in this world. Darcy, Darcy, what sort of trouble have you gotten us into?</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;It's the Lady Nephel! And she's brought a Lady Naiad!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Rather than aggression, the atmosphere turned into something festive. Darcy seemed quite the prankstery type to me, so I figured she'd be the target of enmity, but instead there was nothing but reverence.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Humans are quite fond of benevolent nomids. I've suggested to you that I don't have a home, but I'm something of a protector for this village, so I seldom wander too far away,&rdquo;</span> Darcy explained to me in a quiet tone. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Seeing a new face has gotten them awfully excited.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Many people offered to prepare us a meal, and Darcy said she'd usually pick one at random, but we decided to eat with the village chief to introduce me.</p>
<div class="shortbreak"></div>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;This is Phos, my new friend.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;I see,&rdquo;</span> the chief said with a smile.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Phos, this is the chief.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Pleased to meet you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>We took seats around a wooden table and began eating right away. Darcy was still full from our meal earlier, so she only picked at a few vegetables, but I ate a considerable amount of beef.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;My, my, aren't you the carnivore,&rdquo;</span> the nephel teased.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;It's because I didn't have any breakfast!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>The chief chuckled. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;You're rather lively today, Darcy.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><i>Wasn't she always that way?</i></p>
<p>I noticed that he, unlike the other villagers, called her by name.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;More importantly,&rdquo;</span> Darcy interjected, <span class="dquote">&ldquo;what have the orgs been up to?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Your return was quite timely. They seem to have gotten a cyclops on their side. We can normally handle</span></p>
</div>
<div class="page">
<span class="pagenumber">Page 7</span>
<span class="pageheader">1&mdash;A Quiet Puddle, A Strong Gust</span>
<p class="nohang">
<span class="dquote"> the orgs, but we've never even seen a cyclops, much less fought one.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>I actually had some concept of orgs in my mind&mdash;men with tusks protruding from their mouths and a fighting spirit to match. These villagers, on the other hand, looked nothing like warriors. I raised a brow when I heard they could hold their own against an army of orgs.</p>
<p>The chief shifted to a deeply formal tone. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;I'd like to request your assistance in defeating the cyclops,&rdquo;</span> he said while bowing toward Darcy. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;They're rallying in the northern barrens.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Darcy had a look of deep uncertainty on her face.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;O-of course I'd never ask you to fight in the barrens, the domain of the wyverns. Instead, I'd like to ask you to assist us once the enemy has entered the forest.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;It's not that,&rdquo;</span> Darcy replied. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;I've only just met Phos. I need to keep her out of trouble. She's newly [born], you now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Oh, quit mothering me!&rdquo;</span> I said. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;I'm more worried about <i>you</i>. Fighting a <i>Cyclops</i>?! Is that something that nephel do?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;As long as I have the air and they don't, then they'll never stand a chance against me!&rdquo;</span> she replied with a proud chest thump. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Anyway, consider it done.&rdquo;</span></p>
<div class="shortbreak"></div>
<p>The sun had fully set by the time we returned to the pond. My eyes had quickly adjusted to the darkness, but my vision out of water was pretty poor, so I had to rely on Darcy's nocturnal prowess.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Alright, I guess this is goodnight.&rdquo;</span> Darcy pulled me into a tight hug.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Geez, weren't we supposed to be solitary creatures?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Ohhh, don't be like thaaaat,&rdquo;</span> she replied. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;I'll come by tomorrow&mdash;[there are some things I'd like to teach you about].&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Okay then.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>She was meddlesome, but she was a good person, and having a fellow nomid to show me the ropes</p>

 was like a blessing from the heavens.</p>
<p>After Darcy flapped into the night, only the sound of crickets remained. I slipped into the water, my thoughts wandering across the day's events as I realized my own sleepiness.</p>
<p>As I relaxed, clouded visions of another life began to prick at my mind. My own? Somebody else's? While the visions weren't distinctly bad, they felt hollow.</p>
<p>In contrast to that, right now I was as fulfilled as I could be. Maybe it was just the rush of new experiences and it would fade over time. Regardless, I was looking forward to what else this world had in store for me.</p>
<p>And I was looking forward to seeing that troublesome nephel again. Even submerged in the water, her hug seemed to linger on my skin, carrying me to sleep. With that, my first day came to a close.</p>

<h3>A Hungry Cat, A Sleepy Tree</h3>
</p><p><i>Where am I?</i></p>
<p>A strange place spread out before me&mdash;an expanse of water. Ah, I'd had many of these in the past. Drowning dreams. No matter how far up I swam, I could never make it to the surface before running out of breath.</p>
<p>Terrified, I began pushing my way through the water. Even though I knew it was futile, I always tried to survive. Was this more crude animal instinct, or something poetic? Either way, I reached out and-</p>
<p>*SPLASH* I shot from the surface and landed on a bed of grass, gasping for air. This grass... is... familiar?</p>
<p><i>Ah. Aha. Ahahaha.</i></p>
<p>It wasn't a dream. I live in the water. <i>How embarrassing!</i> I glanced around sharply, praying Darcy hadn't seen it. I had to make sure she never found out!</p>
<p>The nephel was nowhere to be seen. Good. Well, first things first&mdash;I needed to get accustomed to finding food before I ended up inconveniencing myself.</p>
<p>I wandered into the woods in search of familiar plant matter, but found myself subconsciously following the route to the river. Before I realized it, I was already engrossed in lunging at fish. But I failed to catch a single one.</p>
<p>Swallowing my annoyance, I decided to play smart and build a dam out of limbs and brush. Soon, I had a bountiful harvest piling up against the makeshift wall. <i>Take that, mindless mongrels!</i> There were three types of fish in various sizes, and far too many for me to eat, so I indulged myself in selecting a few prime specimens for <span class="squote">&lsquo;flavor study&rsquo;</span>.</p>
<p>A cascade of rustling leaves caught my attention, drawing closer at an alarming speed.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Heeeeee!&rdquo;</span> I shrieked before a massive panther that burst from the brush. However, it ignored me and pounced into the pool of fish against the dam. I had to stop it! It was going to take my food!</p>
<p>Something whizzed by and crashed into the ground. Darcy?! She somehow</p>

 rolled into a stance, standing between me and the cat, holding a crackling sword before her.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Phos! Are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Y-yeah. I was just...&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Goh! Goh!&rdquo;</span> she threatened at the cat while stomping her feet and waving the sword in an intimidating manner. Realizing that it was outmatched, it turned and slunk back into the woods.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo;</span> I said through breath that had not settled yet.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;That's strange. Panthers usually wouldn't attack a nomid without being provoked. Maybe it realized how tasty you look.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;I think it was after my fish. Ah&mdash;<i>my fish!</i>&rdquo;</span> The dam had been broken, and the fish all swam away.</p>
<p><i>You were lucky this time!</i></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Just how many did you&mdash;So your gluttony has finally gotten you into trouble, huh?&rdquo;</span> Darcy teased with a smirk.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Nevermind that&mdash;you have a sword?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;All [nomids] can manifest weapons. One day, you'll face a powerful foe, and it'll instinctively come to you.&rdquo;</span> After a moment, she made a silly face and continued, <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Oops, I might have just chased off your powerful foe.&rdquo;</span> Very interesting. I wondered what sort of weapon a naiad might manifest.</p>
<p>Darcy took pity on me and once again fished up my breakfast with her legendary talons. Self-sufficiency could wait&mdash;I allowed myself to be spoiled once more. She also added some vegetation to the mix, apparently from a small cultivated plot somewhere north of here, beyond the meadows.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Say, why do the orgs attack the village anyway? What are they after?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Hmm, they're probably after the [godstone] enshrined there.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;'Godstone'?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Well, they say that, hundreds of years ago, one of the gods was rioting in the heavens. So the others turned him to stone and dropped him right out of the sky. He crashed into the earth, stone</span></p>

<span class="dquote"> pieces of him scattering everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;These so-called <span class="squote">&lsquo;godstones&rsquo;</span> are pearlescent stones that drain the life from anything nearby. Fortunately, wood blocks the effect, so they've been sealed in wooden boxes and guarded by cities, towns, and villages all over. The unspoken agreement is that each settlement can house no more than one of these powerful stones.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;So that village has a godstone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Exactly!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Why not just throw them in a hole in the ground?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Because somebody would definitely dig them up and use them as weapons of war. Like this sect of orgs, who basically worship dominace. Fortunately, they're always fighting amongst themselves, so they never really form large armies.</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Also, the hephal are underground, and <i>they're</i> an even bigger problem, so that would be the worst place to put a godstone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Wow, my second day in the world and I'd already heard something pretty scary. Could I just curl up in my pond and hide from it all?</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;I've got to leave now. Don't get eaten by a cat while I'm gone. I found you first!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>With that, Darcy turned and flew into the distance northward. Wings really were convenient.</p>
<p>...But my pond was better. :<</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the day exploring. To the north, where Darcy always flew from, there was a vast meadow stretching to reach another forest line and mountains in the distance. In all other directions were just more trees, though there were a couple of particularly large ones.</p>
<p>Healthy soil. Plenty of water. A good variety of small animals and vegetation. Quiet, except for a certain bird woman. Yes, this was a good place to live.</p>
<div class="longbreak"></div>
<p>I woke in the morning and laid my head on the ground, stretching my arms</p>

 across the grass. <i>So warrrm~ So soooft~ </i> My legs dangled freely in the water. My home really was the best.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;HYAYAYIIIII!!!&rdquo;</span> I screamed at the unexpected voice beside me while backflipping across the water. Landing in a crash, I realized that a bow had manifested in my hands, cool blue mist wisping around it.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;This?! This is how you learn to manifest your weapon??! What about that giant jaguar?? My gentle morning greetings are more terrifying than <i>that</i>?!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Oh, so it was just Darcy. She seemed to be upset.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;And here <i>I</i> had wanted a bow. Well, a sword really does suit me best. The gods knew I would be overpowered with a ranged weapon.&rdquo;</span> She was striking a proud pose now, but her words came out shakily.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Are bows rare then?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Huh? No, they're pretty common for freshwater naiads. Anyway, congratulations I guess.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Wow, was she pouting?</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;In a way, I did get a bow, after all,&rdquo;</span> she quietly muttered.</p>
<p><i>I'm not your plaything!</i></p>
<p>I tried to cheer her with an honest compliment: <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Your sword is pretty impressive, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Darcy perked up. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;You like it?&rdquo;</span> She made it appear and waved it around like some sort of spectacle. Tantalizing patterns of electric arcs jumped across a pure white blade.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;How did you get your weapon?&rdquo;</span> I asked, still mesmerized by the sword.</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed as she explained. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;A wyvern&mdash;I almost died. Even with this sword, I was unable to harm it. While it's true that wyverns have an advantage against nephels, I honestly have a deep-seated fear of them ever since that incident.</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Anyway, come, I have something to show you.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>I was going to ask her to teach me how to use the bow, but it seemed she already had something</p>

 in mind. And so, I followed her into the woods.</p>
<div class="shortbreak"></div>
<p>A large tree towered before us. It was one of the two I had noticed yesterday.</p>
<p>Darcy knocked on the trunk as if it were a door. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Helloooo? Cyphus!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>The tree seemed to morph as someone emerged from it. Definitely a dryad, and definitely&mdash;male. Huh, I was expecting another woman. The man had a body that seemed to proclaim <span class="dquote">&ldquo;I'm a walking tree!&rdquo;</span>.</p>
<p>He let out a yawn before his eyes finally met ours.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Cyphus, this is Phos. She's the naiad of the pond.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Oh? The pond has a naiad now? That's good. That's great.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>So he said, but he looked like he was falling back asleep. Where were the magical dryads of lore? Just looking at him, I felt an unnatural boredom welling up within me.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Phos, this is Cyphus. He's your neighbor, so try to get along.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><i>Yeah, bud. You stay in your tree, I'll stay in my pond.</i></p>
<p>As if in sync with my thoughts, he started merging back into the tree. <i>Wait! I didn't mean it!</i></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;The dryad are a bit different. They really do have the spirit of a tree. You'll get used to it.&rdquo;</span> She said it with sincerity, but I understood it more easily as sarcasm.</p>
<p>I took the opportunity to say what I wanted to earlier, holding out my bow: <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Darcy&mdash;How do I use this thing?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>A male voice answered, <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Oh, you have a bow too!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><i>What the heck don't scare me like that!!</i> Cyphus' face was poking out of the tree&mdash;it was insanely creepy&mdash;and he now actually looked awake.</p>
<p>He emerged from his tree again like it was a cocoon or something. <i>Fly away, little butterfly!</i></p>
<p>Cyphus manifested a bow in his hands. It was twice as long as mine, and a beautiful</p>

<div class="page">

<span class="pageheader">2&mdash;A Hungry Cat, A Sleepy Tree</span>
<p class="nohang">
 shade of jade that matched my scales. (<i>Can we trade?</i>) It took the form of woven vines and leaves.</p>
<p>The dryad began instructing me: <span class="dquote">&ldquo;It's quite simple&mdash;Pull back, and release. Don't hold. Once you try, you'll understand. But I'll show you anyway.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>A glowing arrow appeared as he pulled back the string. Once he let go, the arrow whirred into the distance, beyond my range of sight.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Oh, you hit it! I really wish I had a bow too,&rdquo;</span> Darcy remarked.</p>
<p><i>Hit what? What did he hit?</i></p>
<p>We walked to the scene of the crime. A deer! He had killed a [freaking] deer! Shot it dead! How cruel.</p>
<p><i>Hmm, I wonder how deer tastes.</i></p>
<p>I imitated Cyphus' actions and drew my bow, an arrow appearing in place. I released it. *Thud*. Not the tree I was aiming for. <i>I don't understand, Cyphus! I tried, and I don't understand at all!</i></p>
<p>I continued to practice shooting arrows for a while, with Cyphus giving advice. [Though there was a lot to grasp, my aim drastically improved when I realized I could focus a small area in the middle of my vision to much further distances. Cyphus called this a <span class="squote">&lsquo;double lens&rsquo;</span> that freshwater naiads possessed to help with their out-of-water nearsightedness. He was pretty knowledgeable for someone who lived in a tree.]</p>
<div class="shortbreak"></div>
<p>The deer Cyphus [caught] had finished cooking.</p>
<p>As it turns out, deer tastes like murder. Each bite filled me with regret, and I could practically see its teary-eyed ghost staring at me, asking <span class="dquote">&ldquo;why?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><i>I don't know why, little friend. I don't know why.</i></p>
<p>As if on cue, Cyphus explained, <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Because of how few natural predators are in the area, I sometimes have to thin the deer population.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><i>So no hard feelings, right? You can pass on now, right?</i></p>

<p>
 The other two looked on with curiosity as I finished my meal with tears in my eyes.</p>
<p>We bid farewell, and Cyphus returned to his tree. Darcy left on some unstated business again, so I wandered around the meadow north of the pond while practicing with my bow. The wind rolling across the hills here really was serene.</p>
<p>I plucked a few pink four-petaled flowers and placed them in my hair. Immediatly feeling silly, I took them back out and carried them with me to my home, where I propped them up on a rock. It was a pretty low-effort decoration, but I'd enjoy them until they wilted.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Ahhhhhh~&rdquo;</span> All that time out of water and in the wind had really dried my skin out, so the pond revitalized me.</p>

<h3>Marksmanship</h3>
</p><p>Ehh? How long was I asleep? Was it the next day already? *Plop*, my head emerged from the surface of the water. Sun rising in the east. Wind blowing from the north. Cyphus standing in the southeast. Yep, definitely morning.</p>
<p><i>Wait. The heck is he doing here?!</i> My mornings really were too eventful.</p>
<p>The man with the <span class="dquote">&ldquo;I'm a walking tree!&rdquo;</span> body stared blankly in my general direction, but he didn't seem to be looking at anything in particular. Was he... asleep?</p>
<p>So I clapped my hands in front of his face, like any good neighbor would do.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Y-y-y-yes, yes, yes! I, uh... was I just on my way back?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;No, you just got here,&rdquo;</span> I said, before realizing I actually had no idea how long he had been standing there, gazing intently into the universe.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Oh, oh! This.&rdquo;</span> He summoned his bow. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;It was about this.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Really, he couldn't properly wake up unless weapons were involved. Well, it's good for men to have their hobbies.</p>
<p>[Cyphus showed me a technique for firing more powerful shots, and one for firing many arrows in one volley. He hadn't wanted to reveal them with Darcy around. Something about pride among bowmen.]</p>
<p>I wasn't sure if he saw me more as an apprentice or a potential rival, but he was quite eager for me to master the bow. His personality was a little grating to me, but he was a good person and I deeply appreciated his assistance.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Cyphus&mdash;do you know much about the nearby village?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Yes, a small human settlement housing a godstone and lead by one of the [sage priests]. They've had issues with orgs and other attackers. Darcy's harassing usually keeps the orgs away for a while, but this time I hear they've gotten quite an accomplice.&rdquo;</span> Cyphus strained as if listening to a hidden voice. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;In fact, they're marching on the village right now.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><i>What?!</i></p>
</div>

<p>
 <span class="dquote">&ldquo;Darcy had been patrolling to keep an eye on their movements. She's probably preparing to challenge them as we speak.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Eh?! Why didn't she tell me??&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;She probably doesn't want to get you involved in the danger.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;We've got to go help her!&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Regrettably, I cannot leave my tree's area of influence, and it's none of my business anyway.&rdquo;</span> His demeanor sharpened. <span class="dquote">&ldquo;You, on the other hand...&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>Is this why he was in such a hurry to teach me those bow skills? I couldn't tell whether he was apathetic or thoughtful.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;Right.&rdquo;</span> I resolved myself.</p>
<p><span class="dquote">&ldquo;You're still green, though. You'd best stay hidden unless something happens. [Take these&mdash;]&rdquo;</span> [Cyphus handed me two vials of liquid.]</p>
